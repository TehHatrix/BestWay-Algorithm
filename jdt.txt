This stadium really uplifted my opinion about local football and nice place for a weekend night match but be prepared for big crowd

One of the must visit place is this stadium. home of the local football club JDT under the leadership of our Johor Crown Prince TMJ. A lot of transformations have been done and it is worth a visit and get JDT merchandises.

Every Saturday there will be a morning market here starts at 7am till 12pm. If you don't plan to go to the market during this time, do avoid this place because its quite congested the traffic. People parks their car along the road because the parking space have been use for market seller.

Completely stunning image brought by the Johor Prince , Tunku Ismail who were changing a lot of facilities and upgrading the stadium . Have been the unbeatable place for the JDT team for every home game for 4 years straight until today !
